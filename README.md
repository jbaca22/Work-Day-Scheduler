# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
# deployed live at: https://jbaca22.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/
# This application uses Bootstrap, Jquery, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Moment.JS

# This application can be used as a daily calender or task manager for the typical 9-5pm workday. It will remember what you write down even if you refresh the page. The text area is color coded based on how close one is to the actual time of the day. Tasks set for the present time will be red, while the future is green, and the past is grey.
